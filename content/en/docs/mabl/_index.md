The sample campaign listed in this document tree has been compiled with Jasper AI and revised by me. There is a mixure of a brand voice that was compiled through previous Mabl publications and knowledge bases were utilized from a mix of competitors and whitepapers published by Mable. 

In addition to the sample campaign produced through this document tree, I've also included other writings that were either optimized, edited, or writed by me in previous roles.
