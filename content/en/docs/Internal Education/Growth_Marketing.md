## What We Do
We employ a series of pioneering methodologies and systematic analysis to expedite the growth of our customer base while simultaneously minimizing costs. We function as the innovative nucleus of our marketing initiatives.

Product teams are instrumental in creating value, whereas marketing teams undertake the task of communicating this value. Our growth teams ensure that a larger audience experiences the inherent value of an already established product.

Tasked with influencing [growth metrics](https://mixpanel.com/blog/growth-metrics-what-you-should-be-tracking/), our growth teams delve deeply into understanding the customer journey, continuously devising strategies to enhance their experiences. Our data-driven growth experts formulate hypotheses, validate them through micro-experiments, and measure their impact, thereby refining aspects of the marketing or product funnel.

Rather than focusing solely on content aimed at conversions and revenue, we strive to find novel ways to integrate valuable information into each user's ongoing journey. Growth marketing is centered on cultivating customer relationships and loyalty, a long-term strategy where authenticity and engagement generate advocacy and organically augment customer lifetime values.

In contrast to most companies that have separate departments for sales, products, and marketing, our growth team has the unique advantage of being able to seamlessly navigate between these entities to fill gaps. Comprised of growth managers, engineers, data scientists, product managers, marketing teams, designers, and data analysts, our growth team continually monitors and experiments with potential strategies to ascertain their effectiveness.

## Tools in our toolkit
* A/B testing, or more comprehensively, multivariate testing, is a fundamental practice in a robust growth marketing strategy. This involves the execution of either an "A" and "B" test, or a series of multiple tests, to determine which variant of your content (modifying graphics, copy, design, etc.) engages your audience more effectively and boosts your conversion rate.

* Cross-channel marketing: When integrating a cross-channel marketing approach into your growth marketing strategy, it is imperative to focus on individual users, understand their communication preferences, and then devise your campaigns accordingly.

* Customer Lifecycle: The customer lifecycle is the trajectory your customers follow as they become acquainted with, interact with, purchase or convert, and re-engage with your company. For ease of understanding, growth marketers concentrate on three pivotal lifecycle stages: activation, nurture, and reactivation. Each stage serves a specific function in enhancing the customer experience and is often associated with particular campaigns.

Our Engagement Criteria:
* Clear business objectives
* A desired behavior to stimulate
* Business case


Types of projects we engage in: 
* Stimulate a specific behavior
* Optimize a web page
* Actively seek opportunities to test, experiment
* Assist BUs in stimulating more of a specific behavior
* Large-scale customer lifecycle initiatives (high-level impact to the company, solid business case required for engagement)

Your primary objective should be to incessantly test and optimize for superior engagement and an improved customer experience, utilizing strategies to attract customers based on highly personalized preferences. As you explore new strategies, ensure that you are continuously gathering data, enabling you to build, test, and iterate along the journey to continually enrich the customer experience.
